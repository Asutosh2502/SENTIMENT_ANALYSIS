# Sentiment Analysis on Twitter using Sentiment140 Dataset

This project demonstrates sentiment analysis using the **Sentiment140 dataset**, which contains 1.6 million tweets labeled as positive, neutral, or negative. The analysis is done in a Jupyter Notebook and includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference.

## 📘 Project Highlights

- Cleaned and preprocessed tweets (removing stopwords, punctuation, and special characters)
- Tokenization and vectorization of text data
- Built a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes / SVM)
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.
- Predicted sentiment of custom user input

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK / SpaCy (optional for preprocessing)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations)

## 📊 Dataset

The [Sentiment140 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140/data) includes 1.6M tweets with the following structure:

| Polarity | Tweet ID | Date | Query | User | Tweet |
|----------|----------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 0        | ...      | ...  | ...   | ...  | ...   |

- `0`: Negative  
- `2`: Neutral  
- `4`: Positive

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `Sentiment_140.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook / VS Code / Google Colab
3. Rename the dataset to `original_data.csv` and keep it in the same folder
4. Run the cells step by step
